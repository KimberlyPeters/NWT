	<p>The importance of literacy for all cannot be over-emphasised. The social and economic prosperity of any society rests on its people. And a people can only be as productive as they have access to knowledge and information. It is therefore important that due attention be given to basic literacy and numeracy education amongst youths and adults. Basic literacy and numeracy education simply involves understanding and knowing how to read, write and solve basic numerical functions.
	59.3% female literacy rate for Nigerians between 15 and 24 years old. Beyond this national average, we have the division by geopolitical zones, which puts the South East ahead of the rest with 95.4% literacy rate and the Northwest with the lowest at 38% and Lagos State being number 12 and Imo State taking the lead. Notwithstanding, adult basic literacy and numeracy and ICT education can not be empasised enough. </p>
