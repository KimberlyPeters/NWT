	<h2><strong>Teachers</strong> are the essential school-level determinant of children's learning.A capable teacher is one who cares for children and is cognitively sound, skilled, loves teaching, motivated, inspiring and flexible. Unfortunately,in Nigeria, with the case of infrastructural decay in the school system; poor amenities, or in many cases, ill-equipped libraries and laboratories(most public schools) teacher performance remains low across Nigeria, and its a big problem.<br><br>
	We are interested in improving the quality of teaching performance in schools specially public schools of learning by improving the skills of working teachers through short courses as well as encouraging volunteers to teach in disadvantaged schools.
	Good and quality education is more than a basic necessity in the world. Education is regarded as a critical instrument in the battle against poverty and ignorance. It empowers the individual with necessary knowledge and set of skills to actualize potential and maximize opportunities in life.<br><br>
    It is for this reason that governments across the world devote a good chunk of available resources to the development of the educational sector but there is also a difference of quality education amongst less privileged children especially girls and women of certain demographic locations.<br><br>
    In Nigeria, Lagos is arguably the State with the highest number of public schools, students and teachers. It has consistently been churning out the highest number of candidates for public examinations in Nigeria since 1967.  As a melting point with a bourgeoning population in excess of 24 million, provision of qualitative education in Lagos State has been a daunting task.<br><br>
    A quality education is one that focuses on the whole child, the social, emotional, mental, physical, and cognitive development of each student regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographic location. It prepares the child for life, not just for testing.<br><br>
    We are concerned with providing the necessary educational resources to empower the Nigerian underprivileged child especially girls and young women who cannot afford to go to to school, get academic resources, or learn adequately regardless of their location, family socio-economic status, ability.</h2>
